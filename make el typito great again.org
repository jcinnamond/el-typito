In rough order of importance

** Animate ascii art figure dancing in celebration once exercise is completed
** DONE Copy buffer contents to new buffer
   CLOSED: [2016-04-19 Tue 19:25]
** Make buffer write only
** Display stats at the end of the buffer when exercise is complete

I'm thinking we can add some text at the end of the buffer showing
characters per second, errors.

** Collect timing stats
** Disable movement in the buffer

Sounds tricky - I don't know if there is some kind of advice for
movement.

** Display menu once exercise is complete

Containing at least quit and restart.

** Create collections of code to train on
** Make awesome logo, ideally involving octopodes and platypodes
** Comment the code
** Should this be a major mode? I wasn't sure.
